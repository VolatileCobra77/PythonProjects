click windows and type cmd
click enter
open your file explorer and navigate to your desktop
find PythonProjects-Games or something similar
drag and drop that folder into your command prompt
you should see something like this:
C:\users\YOURNAME\>"C:\users\YOURNAME\Desktop\PythonProjects-Games"
use the arrow keys to navigate to between the arrow and quote(>" You should be between those)
make sure the flashing white square is below the first " and type cd and then a space
the new line should now read:
C:\users\YOURNAME\Desktop\PythonProjects-Games>
from there type cd pythonGames
now it should say
C:\users\YOURNAME\Desktop\PythonProjects-Games\pythonGames>
now type python "Data\.pyfiles\main.py" and hit enter
if you get stuck message me!
